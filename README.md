# SASFT: Sparse Autoencoder-guided Supervised Finetuning to Mitigate Unexpected Code-Switching in LLMs

This repository contains the official implementation of "SASFT: Sparse Autoencoder-guided Supervised Finetuning to Mitigate Unexpected Code-Switching in LLMs".

## Overview

We are currently organizing and preparing to release all code and resources used in our paper. This repository will include:

- Implementation of SAE-guided supervised finetuning method
- Code for analyzing code-switching behaviors in LLMs


## Coming Soon

We are actively working on releasing:

- [ ] Complete implementation of SAE-guided finetuning pipeline
- [ ] Code-switching analysis tools
- [ ] Detailed documentation and usage examples
